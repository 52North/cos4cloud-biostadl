# (Optional)
# Defines whether the HttpOnly flag will be set on cookies.
# When not defined the default is On.
#OIDCCookieHTTPOnly [On|Off]

# (Optional)
# The prefix to use when setting claims (openid-connect or oauth20) in the HTTP headers/environment variables.
# When not defined, the default "OIDC_CLAIM_" is used.
#OIDCClaimPrefix <prefix>

# (Optional)
# The delimiter to use when setting multi-valued claims (openid-connect or oauth20) in the HTTP headers/environment variables.
# When not defined the default "," is used.
#OIDCClaimDelimiter <char>

# (Optional)
# The claim that is used when setting the REMOTE_USER variable on OpenID Connect protected paths.
# If the claim name is postfixed with a \"@\", the claim value will be post-fixed with the
# \"iss\" value value (with leading "https://" stripped) to make this value unique across different OPs.
# When not defined the default "sub@" is used.
#
# An optional regular expression can be added as a 2nd parameter that will be applied to the
# resulting value from the 1st parameter and the first match returned from that expression will
# be set as the REMOTE_USER. E.g. to strip a domain from an e-mail style address you'd use ^(.*)@
#OIDCRemoteUserClaim <claim-name>[@] [<regular-expression>]

# (Optional)
# Define the way(s) in which the id_token contents are passed to the application according to OIDCPassClaimsAs.
# Must be one or several of:
# "claims" :     the claims in the id_token are passed in individual headers/environment variables
# "payload" :    the payload of the id_token is passed as a JSON object in the "OIDC_id_token_payload" header/environment variable
# "serialized" : the complete id_token is passed in compact serialized format in the "OIDC_id_token" header/environment variable
# When not defined the default "claims" is used.
#OIDCPassIDTokenAs [claims|payload|serialized]+

# (Optional)
# Define the way in which the claims and tokens are passed to the application environment:
# "none": no claims/tokens are passed
# "environment": claims/tokens are passed as environment variables
# "headers": claims/tokens are passed in headers (also useful in reverse proxy scenario's)
# "both": claims/tokens are passed as both headers as well as environment variables (default)
# When not defined the default is "both"
# The access token is passed in OIDC_access_token; the access token expiry is passed in OIDC_access_token_expires.
# The refresh token is only passed in OIDC_refresh_token if enabled for that specific directory/location (see: OIDCPassRefreshToken)
#OIDCPassClaimsAs [none|headers|environment|both]

# (Optional)
# Specify the HTTP header variable name to set with the name of the authenticated user,
# i.e. copy what is set in REMOTE_USER and configured in OIDCRemoteUserClaim.
# When not defined no such header is added.
# This setting can be configured for both the "openid-connect" and "oauth20" AuthType on
# a server-wide or directory level.
#OIDCAuthNHeader <header-name>

# (Optional)
# Timeout in seconds for long duration HTTP calls. This is used for most requests to remote endpoints/servers.
# When not defined the default of 60 seconds is used.
#OIDCHTTPTimeoutLong <seconds>

# (Optional)
# Timeout in seconds for short duration HTTP calls; used for Client Registration and OP Discovery requests.
# When not defined the default of 5 seconds is used.
#OIDCHTTPTimeoutShort <seconds>

# (Optional)
# Time to live in seconds for state parameter i.e. the interval in which the authorization request
# and the corresponding response need to be processed. When not defined the default of 300 seconds is used.
#OIDCStateTimeout <seconds>

# (Optional)
# OpenID Connect session storage type.
# "server-cache" server-side caching storage.
# "client-cookie" uses browser-side sessions stored in a cookie; see also OIDCSessionCookieChunkSize next
# A suffix ":persistent" can be added if you want to use a persistent cookie that survives browser restarts
# instead of a session cookie that is tied to the lifetime of the browser session.
# The "expires" value of the persistent cookie is controlled by the OIDCSessionInactivityTimeout setting.
# When not defined the default "server-cache" is used.
#OIDCSessionType server-cache[:persistent]|client-cookie[:persistent]

# (Optional)
# OpenID Connect session cookie chunk size.
# When using "OIDCSessionType client-cookie" the session cookie may become quite large if a lot of session
# data needs to be stored, typically the size depends on the "scopes" of information you request. To work
# around cookie size limitations for most web browsers (usually 4096 bytes), the "client-cookie" will be split
# over a number of "chunked" cookies if the resulting session data is over a certain number of bytes,
# If you want to prevent splitting the session cookie regardless of its size, set the value to 0.
# When not defined the default chunk size is 4000 bytes
#OIDCSessionCookieChunkSize 4000

# (Optional)
# Scrub user name and claim headers (as configured above) from the user's request.
# The default is "On"; use "Off" only for testing and debugging because it renders your system insecure.
#OIDCScrubRequestHeaders [On|Off]

# (Optional)
# Specify an outgoing proxy for your network.
# When not defined no outgoing proxy is used.
#OIDCOutgoingProxy <host>[:<port>]

# (Optional)
# Defines the action to be taken when an unauthenticated request is made.
# "auth" means that the user is redirected to the OpenID Connect Provider or Discovery page.
# "401" means that HTTP 401 Unauthorized is returned.
# "410" means that HTTP 410 Gone is returned
# "pass" means that an unauthenticated request will pass but claims will still be passed when a user happens to be authenticated already
# Useful in Location/Directory/Proxy path contexts that serve AJAX/Javascript calls and for "anonymous access"
# When not defined the default "auth" is used.
#OIDCUnAuthAction [auth|pass|401|410]

# (Optional)
# Specify the names of cookies to pickup from the browser and send along on backchannel
# calls to the OP and AS endpoints. This can be used for load-balancing purposes.
# When not defined, no such cookies are sent.
#OIDCPassCookies [<cookie-name>]+

# (Optional)
# Specify the names of cookies to strip from the incoming request so they are not passed
# on to the target application(s). This may prevent a large set of chunked session cookies to
# be sent to the backend. In that case you'd set it to (when using the default OIDCCookie setting):
#   mod_auth_openidc_session mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks mod_auth_openidc_session_0 mod_auth_openidc_session_1
# When not defined, no cookies are stripped.
#OIDCStripCookies [<cookie-name>]+

# (Optional)
# The refresh interval in seconds for the claims obtained from the userinfo endpoint
# When not defined the default is 0, i.e. the claims are retrieved only at session creation time.
# NB: this can be overridden on a per-OP basis in the .conf file using the key: userinfo_refresh_interval
#OIDCUserInfoRefreshInterval <seconds>

# (Optional)
# Indicates whether POST data will be preserved across authentication requests (and discovery in case of multiple OPs).
# Preservation is done via HTML 5 local storage. Note that this can lead to private data exposure on shared terminals,
# that is why the default is "Off". Can be configured on a per Directory/Location basis.
#OIDCPreservePost [On|Off]

# (Optional)
# Indicates whether the refresh token will be passed to the application in a header/environment variable, according
# to the OIDCPassClaimsAs directive.
# Can be configured on a per Directory/Location basis. The default is "Off".
#OIDCPassRefreshToken [On|Off]

# (Optional)
# Request Object/URI settings. For example:
# "{ \"copy_from_request\": [ \"claims\", \"response_type\", \"response_mode\", \"login_hint\", \"id_token_hint\", \"nonce\", \"state\", \"redirect_uri\", \"scope\", \"client_id\" ], \"static\": { \"some\": \"value\", \"some_nested\": { \"some_array\": [ 1,2,3] } }, \"crypto\": { \"sign_alg\": \"HS256\", \"crypt_alg\": \"A256KW\", \"crypt_enc\": \"A256CBC-HS512\" }, \"url\": \"https://www.pingidentity.nl/protected/\" }"
# NB: this can be overridden on a per-OP basis in the .conf file using the key: request_object
#OIDCRequestObject <stringified-JSON-object>

# (Optional)
# Provider metadata refresh interval for the metadata in a multi-provider setup (with OIDCMetadataDir).
# When not defined the default is 0 seconds, i.e. it is never refreshed.
# Also used in a single provider setup with OIDCProviderMetadatURL but 0 then means the default of 1 day.
#OIDCProviderMetadataRefreshInterval <seconds>
